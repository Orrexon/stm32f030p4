# stm32f030p4
low level api specifically for the stm32f3030* aka demo board

It is really specifically made for stm32f303p*. Do not use it with other boards. 
There are many libs out there. There are IDEs and more than one standard API, all of which are generic and will fit your board.

I am doing this for myself, anything can change any time.

If you know what you are doing and think any of this is useful to you, you're welcome.
